objectphone
===========

It's our [API](http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api), on your phone. Object Phone is a simple app that uses [Twilio](http://twilio.com) to allow you to 'listen' to our collections metadata. I originally posted a [blog on Cooper-Hewitt Labs](http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2013/object-phone/), but it has matured a bit since that post.  

objectphone is currently at (718) 213-4915
